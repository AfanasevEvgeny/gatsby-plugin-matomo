‚öõÔ∏èüìÑüöÄ Gatsby plugin to add [Matomo](https://matomo.org) (formerly Piwik) onto a site.

## Features

Plugin uses sensible defaults prioritizing user experience & privacy:

- include tracking code in all server-side rendered routes
- track all route views as custom events
- load tracking scripts at end of `body` tag
- use image tracking fallback for `noscript`
- don't load anything when visitor has Do Not Track enabled
- don't load anything in non-production environments
- allow loading tracking script locally
- dev mode for local development

## Usage

1. First, install the plugin from your project's root:

    ```bash
    cd yourproject/
    npm i gatsby-plugin-matomo
    ```

2. Then load the plugin from your `gatsby-config.js` and set the required variables:

    ```js
    plugins: [
      {
        resolve: 'gatsby-plugin-matomo',
        options: {
          siteId: 'YOUR_SITE_ID',
          matomoUrl: 'https://YOUR_MATOMO_URL.COM',
          siteUrl: 'https://YOUR_LIVE_SITE_URL.COM'
        }
      }
    ]
    ```

3. That's it!

_NOTE: By default, this plugin only generates output when run in production mode. To test your tracking code, run `gatsby build && gatsby serve`, or set `dev` option to `true`_.

## Options

Option        | Explanation
--------------|---------
`siteId`      | Your Matomo site ID configured in your Matomo installation.
`matomoUrl`   | The url of your Matomo installation.
`siteUrl`     | The url of your site, usually the same as `siteMetadata.siteUrl`. Only used for generating the url for `noscript` image tracking fallback.
`localScript` | (optional) Set path to load local `piwik.js` script, instead of loading it from your `matomoUrl`.
`dev`         | (optional) Activate dev mode by setting to `true`. Will load all scripts despite not running in `production` environment. Ignores your local browser's DNT header too. Outputs some information in console about what it is doing. Useful for local testing but careful: all hits will be send like in production.

## Development

```bash
npm i
npm run build

# publishing to npm & GitHub releases
# uses https://github.com/webpro/release-it
npm run release
npm run release-minor
npm run release-major
```
